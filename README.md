# DairyMart
My first attempt at creating an e-commerce website was DairyMart, which I built using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL.


# Live Model
I utilised the free web hosting service InfinityFree Website to get this website live on the internet.

# Run

Download the necessary files, then start a browser to access the index.php file to make this website work.

Import the sql database in the XAMPP.

# Additional Info

Only the customer site of the process is displayed on this website; to access the selling page, type admin before index.php in the navigation link.

dairymart.infinityfreeapp.com/index.php ==>  dairymart.infinityfreeapp.com/admin/admin_login.php

# Account & Password

In order to access this website, users must register and log in.

Both the username and the password are admin while on the admin page.
